- This blob contains the set of glue code and configuration files used to carry out
  the AARTFAAC rawdata recording into LOFAR CEP2, during 19-20Nov13.
- udp-copy was modified to support online conversion of the incoming 16-bit complex
  subbands to 8-bit complex, and also writing a single subband to disk.
- The folder 19Nov13/ contains the logs of that observation, including helper files
  needed to copy the data out of the CEP2 nodes and into the ASTRON Nexpress 
  machine.
